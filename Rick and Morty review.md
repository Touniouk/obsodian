# Rick and Morty is pretty smart actually
## You need a pretty high IQ to understand it

Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted, but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures

>To be fair, you have to have a _very_ high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from _Narodnaya Volya_ literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly _appreciate_ the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic _Fathers and Sons_ I'm smirking right now just _imagining_ one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I _pity_ them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

It's like Idiocracy except not lazy and actually smart and with a bigger dick and stacks paper and also not dumb and also not eugenics and maybe kinda gross but not racist
